<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a software and DevOps engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. My work focuses on building reliable systems, writing clean code, and understanding problems deeply before implementing solutions. I value structure, clarity, and correctness in both engineering and communication.
</p>
<p>
  I have hands-on experience across the full stack, working with technologies such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and relational and NoSQL databases. I approach projects with an engineering mindset: define the problem, design the system, implement with discipline, and iterate based on feedback.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond development, I am intentional about continuous learning and skill transfer. I enjoy teaching and breaking down complex concepts into simple, practical explanations, whether through mentoring, documentation, or technical content. This has strengthened my ability to think clearly and communicate effectively within teams.
</p>
<p>
  I am driven by impact, not hype. I prefer building solutions that are maintainable, scalable, and useful in real-world scenarios. My goal is to keep growing as an engineer while contributing to products and teams that value quality, ownership, and long-term thinking.
